## Customization Tips

**Make it specific:**
- Include your industry context: "I'm in [B2B SaaS/Real Estate/Retail]"
- Specify metrics that matter: "Focus on CAC, LTV, churn rate"
- Define your goals: "Looking to reduce churn" vs "Looking to increase AOV"

**Better data = better insights:**
- Include column headers
- Paste 10-20 sample rows (not thousands)
- Describe any data quirks or missing values

**Ask for explanations:**
- Add: "Explain your methodology"
- Add: "Show your calculations"
- Add: "What assumptions are you making?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Pasting too much data** - AI has limits. Paste a representative sample

❌ **No context** - Explain what the data represents and what you're trying to learn

❌ **Unclear metrics** - Define what success looks like

❌ **Not verifying results** - Always spot-check AI's math

❌ **Ignoring outliers** - Ask AI to explain unusual data points

## Next Steps

1. **Start simple** - Try the Sales Performance Summary prompt
2. **Iterate** - Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper
3. **Save templates** - Keep your best-performing prompts
4. **Combine with tools** - Upload Excel files directly to ChatGPT/Claude
5. **Verify important insights** - Always double-check critical analysis
