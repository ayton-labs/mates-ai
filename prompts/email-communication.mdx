❌ **Copying without reviewing** - Always read and personalize
❌ **Same prompt for every audience** - Adjust tone for recipient
❌ **Forgetting call-to-action** - Make next steps clear
❌ **Over-formal or under-formal** - Match the relationship
❌ **Too long** - Aim for under 200 words for most emails

## Next Steps

1. **Bookmark this page**
2. **Try 3 prompts this week**
3. **Save your favorites** to notes or text expansion
