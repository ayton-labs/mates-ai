## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **No tone guidance** - Specify formal/casual, technical/accessible, urgent/informative

❌ **Missing key details** - Include audience knowledge level, time constraints, required sections

❌ **Not editing AI output** - Always personalize with your voice, data, examples

❌ **Forgetting the goal** - Every piece of content should have a clear purpose

## Next Steps

1. **Start with outlines** - Use AI to structure, then fill in details yourself
2. **Iterate in chunks** - Perfect one section before moving to the next
3. **Add your voice** - Edit AI drafts to sound like you
4. **Save templates** - Keep prompts that work for recurring content
5. **Mix AI + human** - Use AI for first drafts, human polish for final version
