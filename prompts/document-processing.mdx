## Best Practices

**Do:**
✅ Upload PDFs directly to ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro for best results
✅ Be specific about what you're looking for ("extract pricing" vs "summarize")
✅ Ask for page numbers so you can verify
✅ Use for first-pass review, verify critical details yourself
✅ Combine multiple prompts (extract + analyze + compare)

**Don't:**
❌ Trust AI blindly with legal/financial documents (always verify)
❌ Share confidential documents (use anonymized versions for testing)
❌ Skip human review of outputs (AI can miss context)
❌ Use generic prompts ("summarize this") - be specific
❌ Forget to specify output format (table, bullets, brief)

---

## Pro Tips

**Claude vs ChatGPT for documents:**
- **Claude**: Better for very long documents (200+ pages), detailed analysis
- **ChatGPT**: Faster, good for most documents under 100 pages

**Upload documents directly** rather than copy-pasting when possible (preserves formatting, page numbers)

**Chain prompts** for complex analysis:
1. First: "Extract key data to table"
2. Then: "Analyze this table for trends and insights"
3. Finally: "Recommend actions based on analysis"

**Save templates** for recurring document types (contracts, proposals, reports)
