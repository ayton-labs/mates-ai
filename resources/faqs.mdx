# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### Which AI should I start with - ChatGPT or Claude?
**Short answer**: ChatGPT

**Why**: Larger user base means more help available, best mobile app, voice mode is excellent, and it's the most versatile general-purpose AI.

**See full comparison**: [ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini](../tools/chatgpt-vs-claude-vs-gemini)

### Should I pay for the Plus/Pro version?
**If you use it daily**: Yes, absolutely worth $20/month

**If occasional**: Start with free tier, upgrade when you hit limits

**ROI**: If you save 1 hour per week, that's $20+ in value for most professionals

### How long does it take to get good at this?
**Basic proficiency**: 1 week
**Comfortable**: 2-3 weeks
**Advanced**: 1-2 months of regular use

**The key**: Use it every day, even for small tasks

## Using AI Effectively

### Why are my results not good?
**Common causes**:
1. **Prompts too vague** - Add more specifics and context
2. **No examples** - Show AI what "good" looks like
3. **Wrong tool** - Claude for long docs, ChatGPT for speed
4. **Not iterating** - First results are drafts, refine them

**Solution**: Read our [Prompt Writing Guide](../getting-started/prompt-writing-guide)

### How do I know if output is accurate?
**Always verify**:
- Facts and statistics
- Technical specifications
- Legal or financial information
- Anything consequential

**AI is great for**: Drafting, formatting, brainstorming, structure
**AI is not great for**: Perfect factual accuracy without verification

### Can people tell I'm using AI?
**Not if you**:
- Review and personalize all outputs
- Add your own voice and examples
- Edit for your specific situation
- Use AI as a drafting tool, not final output

**Think of it like**: Spellcheck or grammar tools - helpful, but you're still writing

## Security & Privacy

### Is it safe to use for work?
**With precautions, yes**

**DON'T share**:
- Customer personal data
- Confidential contracts (specific terms)
- Financial details
- Passwords or credentials
- Proprietary information

**DO use for**:
- Your own drafts
- Anonymized examples
- Public information
- General scenarios
- Workflow help

**Rule of thumb**: "Would I email this to a stranger?" If no, don't put it in AI.

### What's the difference between free and paid privacy?
**Free accounts**:
- Data may be used for training (ChatGPT Free does this)
- Less privacy protection

**Paid accounts** (Plus/Pro):
- Your conversations DON'T train the model
- Better privacy protections
- Enterprise-grade for business use

**Business/Enterprise accounts**:
- Strongest privacy guarantees
- Admin controls
- Compliance features

### Can my company see what I'm doing?
**On free accounts**: Possibly, if they have monitoring
**On paid personal accounts**: No, unless you share
**On company-provided accounts**: Yes, assume they can

## Tools & Integrations

### Do I need other tools beyond ChatGPT/Claude?
**Most people**: No, ChatGPT or Claude covers 80% of needs

**Add specialized tools when**:
- You do that task daily
- General AI isn't good enough
- Tool saves significant extra time

**Most valuable additions**:
1. Transcription (Otter.ai for meetings)
2. Design (Canva for graphics)
3. Research (Perplexity for sourced info)

**See full guide**: [Specialized AI Tools](../tools/specialized-ai-tools)

### What about browser extensions?
**Most aren't necessary**. Copy-paste to ChatGPT works fine.

**Exceptions worth considering**:
- Grammarly (writing quality)
- ChatGPT for Gmail (if you live in Gmail)

**See full guide**: [Browser Extensions](../tools/browser-extensions)

## Advanced Questions

### What are ChatGPT Projects?
**Think of them as**: Specialized AI assistants that remember your context

**Use for**: Tasks you do repeatedly (email responses, document analysis, etc.)

**Learn more**: [ChatGPT Projects Guide](../guides/chatgpt-projects)

### What's the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-4o?
**GPT-4o**: Faster, multimodal (text+image+voice), cheaper - use for most tasks

**GPT-4**: Original, slightly more thoughtful on complex tasks

**o1-preview**: Special reasoning model for math, logic, complex problems

**For most work**: GPT-4o is the best choice

### Should I learn prompt engineering?
**Deep expertise? No** - Unless it's your job

**Basic skills? Yes** - Learn enough to get good results

**What you need**:
1. Be specific
2. Include context
3. Define format
4. Iterate

**That's 90% of it**. See our [Prompt Writing Guide](../getting-started/prompt-writing-guide)

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm getting rate limited / error messages"
**Causes**:
- Hit free tier limit (wait or upgrade)
- Too many requests too fast (slow down)
- System issues (try again later)

**Solutions**:
1. Upgrade to Plus/Pro ($20/month)
2. Space out requests
3. Try alternate AI (Claude if ChatGPT is down)

### "Uploads aren't working"
**Common issues**:
- File too large (usually 25-50MB limit)
- Unsupported format (PDF, Word, text work best)
- System issues (try again)

**Solutions**:
- Copy-paste text instead
- Compress or split large files
- Convert to PDF
- Try Claude (handles larger files)

### "Voice mode isn't working"
**Check**:
- Microphone permissions enabled
- Using supported device (mobile app is best)
- Have Plus subscription (voice mode requires Plus)
- Internet connection stable
