‚úÖ Focus on publicly available information
‚úÖ Update regularly (markets move fast)
‚úÖ Share insights with sales and product teams
‚úÖ Use AI to spot patterns across dozens of data points

**Don't:**
‚ùå Rely on AI for real-time pricing (check competitor sites directly)
‚ùå Share proprietary information in prompts
‚ùå Assume AI has latest data (verify recent changes)
‚ùå Use AI to spread misinformation about competitors
‚ùå Skip human analysis of strategic implications

---

## Tools & Setup

**Best AI for competitive research:**
- **ChatGPT Plus** (with web browsing): Best for real-time research
- **Claude Pro**: Better for analyzing long competitor documents
- **Perplexity Pro**: Excellent for sourced research with citations

**Also useful:**
- **Built With** (tech stack research)
- **SimilarWeb** (traffic analytics)
- **Crunchbase** (funding/company data)

**Upgrade worth it?**
Yes if you do competitive research monthly. Web browsing and longer context windows save hours.

## Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Asking AI to "spy" on competitors** - Only use public information

‚ùå **Not verifying AI research** - Always check sources, especially pricing

‚ùå **One-time analysis** - Markets change, make it ongoing

‚ùå **Analysis paralysis** - Focus on actionable insights, not exhaustive reports

‚ùå **Forgetting to share** - Competitive intel only helps if sales/product knows it

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start small**: Pick your #1 competitor and create a battlecard (20 min)
2. **Make it routine**: Set monthly calendar reminder for competitor check
3. **Share widely**: Send competitive insights to sales and product teams
4. **Measure impact**: Track how competitive intel improves win rates
