**During viewings (via Voice Mode):**
- Client asks about property → Speak to ChatGPT, get instant analysis (prompt #5)

**Weekly time saved: 8-12 hours**

## Pro Tips for Estate Agents

**Upload once, reuse forever:**
- Your standard bio and credentials
- Neighbourhood guides and school catchment info
- Common disclosure language
- Your agency's standard terms

Save these in a [ChatGPT Project](../guides/chatgpt-projects) called "Estate Agency Assistant"

**Voice Mode is game-changing when:**
- Driving between viewings (dictate property notes)
- At viewings (quick lookups whilst talking to buyers)
- Evening follow-up calls (speak email drafts instead of typing)

**Best practices:**
- Always fact-check property details and prices
- Personalise AI outputs before sending (add your voice)
- Use AI for first draft, your expertise for final decision
- Never share client confidential info in prompts (use "Client A" instead of names)

## Common Mistakes

❌ Using generic property descriptions (add neighbourhood personality and lifestyle benefits)

❌ Not customising email templates (add one personal sentence per client)

❌ Forgetting to verify comparables and dates (AI can hallucinate numbers)

❌ Over-relying on AI for pricing strategy (use it to draft, your expertise to decide)
