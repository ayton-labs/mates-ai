## Common Mistakes

❌ **Using AI for financial modeling** - AI can explain assumptions but shouldn't build Excel models

❌ **Not fact-checking market data** - Always verify cap rates, rent comps, vacancy rates with sources

❌ **Generic investor updates** - Customize LP communications, don't send one-size-fits-all

❌ **Forgetting compliance** - Review all investor communications with legal/compliance

❌ **Over-relying on AI for market knowledge** - Use AI to synthesize, but develop your own expertise

## Next Steps

**Start here:**
1. Try prompt #1 on your current deal - see how it structures investment thesis
2. Use prompt #2 to synthesize market research you've already done
3. Customize prompts with your firm's specific terminology and formats

**Get advanced:**
- Create [ChatGPT Projects](/guides/chatgpt-projects) for recurring analyses (market reports, LP updates)
- Build prompt templates for your specific property types and markets
- Use [Voice Mode](/guides/voice-mode-tricks) to dictate deal notes after site visits

**For associates:**
Focus on prompts #1, #2, #4 - these are your highest-impact time savers for supporting senior team.

**For principals/partners:**
Focus on prompts #3, #5, #6 - these help with investor relations and deal sourcing strategy.
