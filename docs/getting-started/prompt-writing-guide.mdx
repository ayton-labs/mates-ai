## The Golden Rule: Shit IN = Shit OUT

**The single most important thing to understand about AI:**

If you give it vague, lazy prompts ‚Üí You get generic, useless results

If you give it detailed, thoughtful prompts ‚Üí You get excellent, tailored results

**It's that simple.** The quality of what you put in determines the quality of what you get out.

Think of AI like a brilliant assistant who:
- Knows everything but nothing about YOUR specific situation
- Can do anything but needs clear instructions
- Works fast but can't read your mind

**Your job**: Provide the context, details, and specifics that make the output useful.

## The Golden Formula

```
[Role/Context] + [Task] + [Specifics] + [Format/Tone] = Effective Prompt
```

### Breaking It Down

**Role/Context**: Who you are and the situation
- "I'm a sales manager preparing a quarterly review."
- "I'm planning a team offsite meeting for 15 people."

**Task**: What you want AI to do
- "Write an email..."
- "Analyze this data..."
- "Create a list of..."
- "Summarize this document..."

**Specifics**: Details that matter
- Length (words, paragraphs)
- Key points to include
- What to avoid
- Target audience

**Format/Tone**: How it should be delivered
- Tone: professional, warm, formal, conversational
- Format: bullet points, paragraph, table, email
- Style: concise, detailed, creative, analytical

---

## Examples: Bad vs Good

### Example 1: Email Writing

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Write an email about the project
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm a project manager. Write a 150-word email to my team announcing that we're launching the new client portal next Monday.

Include:
- Go-live date and time (Monday 9am)
- What's changing for them
- Where to find training materials
- Who to contact with questions

Tone should be clear and encouraging (not overwhelming). Make them feel prepared.
```

**Why it's better**: Clear context, specific details, defined length, tone guidance.

---

### Example 2: Data Analysis

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Look at this data
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm a sales director. Analyze this Q1 sales data and:
1. Identify top 5 performing products
2. Highlight any concerning trends
3. Compare performance to same period last year
4. Suggest 3 actionable insights for Q2 planning

Format as an executive summary (max 300 words) with bullet points for key findings.

[paste data]
```

**Why it's better**: Specific analytical tasks, clear output format, actionable focus.

---

### Example 3: Content Creation

‚ùå **Bad Prompt**:
```
Write a social post
```

‚úÖ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm a marketing coordinator. Write a LinkedIn post (200 words max) about our company's new remote work policy.

Key points:
- Hybrid model: 3 days in office, 2 days remote
- Employees choose which days
- Starting next month
- Focus on work-life balance and productivity

Tone: Professional but approachable. Emphasis on employee wellbeing and trust. Include 3 relevant hashtags.
```

**Why it's better**: Platform specified, word limit, key messages, tone, format requirements.

## The Six Principles of Great Prompts

### 1. Be Specific

**Vague**: "Help me with marketing"
**Specific**: "Create 5 email subject lines for our Black Friday sale targeting customers who haven't purchased in 6 months"

### 2. Provide Context

**No context**: "Write a report"
**With context**: "I'm presenting to the executive team about customer satisfaction. Write a 1-page summary of these survey results highlighting key trends and recommendations"

### 3. Define the Output

**Undefined**: "Analyze this"
**Defined**: "Create a table with 3 columns: Finding, Impact, Recommendation"

### 4. Set Constraints

**Unconstrained**: "Write an email"
**Constrained**: "Write a 100-word email. Keep it under 3 paragraphs. Don't mention pricing."

### 5. Specify Tone

**No tone**: "Respond to this complaint"
**With tone**: "Respond with empathy and professionalism, acknowledging the frustration without being defensive"

### 6. Use Examples (When Helpful)

```
Write 3 product descriptions in this style:

EXAMPLE:
"The Pro Desk Chair - Engineered for all-day comfort with ergonomic lumbar support and breathable mesh. Adjustable height and arms. $299"

Now write for: [your products]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought
Ask AI to think step-by-step.

```
Before giving your final answer, think through:
1. What are the key customer needs?
2. What makes this solution unique?
3. How does it compare to alternatives?

Then write the proposal.
```

### Technique 2: Role Playing
Make AI adopt a specific perspective.

```
You are an expert business consultant with 20 years experience. Review this strategy and identify potential blind spots.
```

### Technique 3: Multiple Options
Ask for variations to choose from.

```
Give me 5 different versions of this headline, ranging from conservative to bold.
```

### Technique 4: Iterative Refinement
Build on previous responses.

```
Prompt 1: "Draft an email about..."
Prompt 2: "Make it 30% shorter"
Prompt 3: "Add more emphasis on urgency"
Prompt 4: "Perfect. Now create a subject line."
```

### Technique 5: Templates
Create reusable prompt structures.

```
I need a [type of content] for [audience] about [topic].

Key messages:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]
- [point 3]

Tone: [tone]
Length: [length]
Format: [format]
```

**The Voice Method: The Easiest Way to Prompt**

Instead of typing, press the **Voice Mode** button in ChatGPT (the headphone/waveform icon) and simply speak to it like a colleague.

Speaking is faster, more natural, and helps you convey nuance and context that's harder to type. You can even use the "full-circle method" to design better prompts by speaking.

**Example:**
> "I am trying to create a proposal for a new client ‚Äî can you help me write a prompt for that?"

The AI will then generate a clear, structured prompt for you. You can refine it together through conversation before running the final version.

**Why it works**: Speaking lets you think aloud, express tone and emotion, and course-correct mid-sentence. It's like brainstorming with a creative partner instead of typing instructions.

Try it ‚Äî your prompts will improve instantly.

[paste content]
```

### Pattern 2: Brainstorming
```
I need ideas for [goal/project].

Context:
- Audience: [who]

## Troubleshooting: When Results Are Bad

### Problem: Output is too generic
**Solution**: Add more specific details and context

### Problem: Wrong tone
**Solution**: Be explicit: "Use a warm, conversational tone" or "Keep it formal and professional"

### Problem: Too long/short
**Solution**: Specify exact length: "100 words" or "3 bullet points" or "1 paragraph"

### Problem: Missing key information
**Solution**: List must-include points explicitly

### Problem: Factually incorrect
**Solution**: AI isn't reliable for facts. Always verify or provide the facts yourself

### Problem: Doesn't sound like "me"
**Solution**: Provide examples of your style or specific phrases to use/avoid

---

## The Iteration Mindset

**Remember**: First outputs are drafts, not finals.

**Iteration examples**:
- "Make this more concise"
- "Use simpler language"
- "Add more detail about [topic]"
- "Remove the section about [topic]"
- "Make it sound more [adjective]"
- "Rewrite the opening to be more engaging"
- "Give me 3 alternative versions"

## Security & Privacy: What to Share (and Not Share)

### ‚úÖ Good Security Practices

**DON'T share**:
- Complete financial accounts or detailed financial data
- Customer personal information (names, emails, addresses, payment details)
- Passwords, API keys, or login credentials
- Confidential contracts (specifics)
- Unreleased product plans or pricing strategies
- Personal employee information (salaries, performance reviews)

**DO feel free to share**:
- Anonymized or example data ("Here's a sample sales report structure")
- Public information (competitor websites, published articles)
- General scenarios ("A customer is unhappy about a delay...")
- Your own work drafts (emails, copy, documents)
- Aggregated data without specific identifiers
- Process questions and workflow descriptions

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Simple Security Rules

**Rule 1: Remove names and identifying details**
- Instead of: "John Smith bought $5,000 of products"
- Use: "A customer bought $5,000 of products"

**Rule 2: Use representative examples**
- Instead of: [uploading actual supplier contract]
- Use: "I have a supplier contract with these key sections: [list]. Help me summarize..."

**Rule 3: Ask yourself: "Would I email this to someone outside the company?"**
- If no ‚Üí Don't put it in AI
- If yes ‚Üí Generally fine to use

**Rule 4: When in doubt, ask**
- Check with your manager
- Better safe than sorry

### üí° How to Use AI Safely and Effectively

**For Financial Analysis**:
‚ùå Don't upload: "Company Q4 2024 Full P&L.xlsx"
‚úÖ Do this: "I have sales data showing a 15% increase in Product A but 10% decrease in Product B. Help me analyze what might be driving this and what actions to consider."

**For Customer Communications**:
‚ùå Don't share: "Customer Jane Smith (jane@email.com) is unhappy about order #12345"
‚úÖ Do this: "A customer's order is delayed by 2 weeks. Help me draft an apology email offering a gesture of goodwill."

**For Contract Review**:
‚ùå Don't upload: Full contract with pricing and terms
‚úÖ Do this: "I'm reviewing a supplier contract. The key terms are [summarize without specific numbers]. What questions should I be asking?"

2. ‚úÖ Is my task crystal clear?
3. ‚úÖ Have I specified length/format?
4. ‚úÖ Have I defined the tone?
5. ‚úÖ Have I mentioned any constraints?
6. ‚úÖ Will AI have all the information it needs?
7. ‚úÖ Am I sharing anything confidential that I shouldn't?
