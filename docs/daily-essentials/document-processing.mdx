title: Document Processing with AI
description: Turn hours of document work into minutes - summarize, analyze, extract, and quality check anything
---

**That industry report doesn't need 2 hours. It needs 5 minutes with AI.**

Here's how to process documents 10x faster than reading them manually.

---

## The Document Problem

**What takes forever:**
- Reading long reports (30+ pages)
- Extracting key points from contracts
- Comparing multiple documents
- Quality checking your own writing
- Finding specific info in dense documents
- Turning messy notes into polished docs

**What AI changes:**
- 50-page report → 5-minute summary with key insights
- Contract review in 10 minutes instead of 1 hour
- Side-by-side comparison of 3 proposals in minutes
- Quality check your work before sending
- Extract exactly what you need from any document

**Time saved**: 2-3 hours per day if you work with documents

---

## The 6 Document Tasks You Do Weekly

### 1. Summarize Long Documents
**The situation**: You have a 40-page industry report, contract, proposal, or research paper. You need the key points.

**Without AI**: 1-2 hours to read and take notes
**With AI**: 5-10 minutes

**How to use AI:**

**For Claude (best for long docs):**
```
I'm uploading a [type of document]. Please:

1. Provide a 3-5 bullet executive summary (key takeaways)
2. Identify the main sections and what each covers
3. Highlight any critical numbers, dates, or deadlines
4. Note any risks, concerns, or red flags
5. Extract action items (if any)

Keep the summary under 500 words total.

[upload/paste document]
```

**Example Output:**
> **Executive Summary:**
> - Market growing at 15% annually, driven by mobile adoption
> - Three main competitors identified with 60% market share
> - Recommended entry strategy: focus on mid-market segment
> - Estimated investment: $2-3M over 18 months
> - Key risk: regulatory changes expected in Q2 2026
>
> **Main Sections:**
> 1. Market Overview (pages 1-12): Size, growth, trends
> 2. Competitive Analysis (pages 13-24): Player profiles, positioning
> 3. Opportunity Assessment (pages 25-35): Where to play, how to win
> 4. Financial Projections (pages 36-45): Investment, returns, risks
>
> **Critical Numbers:**
> - Total addressable market: $450M
> - Current year growth: 15.2%
> - Average customer LTV: $12K
> - Customer acquisition cost: $2.5K
>
> **Red Flags:**
> - Pending regulation could impact pricing (page 38)
> - Top competitor raised $50M recently (page 19)
> - Customer churn increasing industry-wide (page 8)

**Time saved**: 90 minutes per long document

**Pro tip**: Claude handles 200K tokens (~500 pages). For very long docs, use Claude.

### 2. Extract Specific Information
**The situation**: You need to find specific info buried in a long document. Names, dates, terms, pricing, specific clauses.

**Without AI**: 20-40 minutes of ctrl+F and reading context
**With AI**: 2 minutes

**How to use AI:**
```
I'm uploading a [document type]. Please extract:

- [Specific item 1]
- [Specific item 2]
- [Specific item 3]

For each item, provide:
- The information
- Page number or section where it appears
- Relevant context

[upload/paste document]
```

**Example:**
```
I'm uploading a supplier contract. Please extract:

- Payment terms (when payment is due, acceptable methods)
- Delivery timeline and milestones
- Cancellation policy (notice period, penalties)
- Liability limits
- Auto-renewal terms

For each, include the page number and any relevant conditions.
```

**AI Output:**
> **Payment Terms (Page 4, Section 3.2):**
> - Net 30 days from invoice date
> - Acceptable methods: Wire transfer, check
> - Late payment: 1.5% monthly interest after 30 days
>
> **Delivery Timeline (Page 6, Section 4.1):**
> - Milestone 1: Initial delivery within 45 days of PO
> - Milestone 2: Final delivery within 90 days
> - Condition: Subject to material availability
>
> **Cancellation Policy (Page 9, Section 7.3):**
> - 30-day written notice required
> - Cancellation fee: 15% of remaining contract value
> - No fee if cancelled due to material breach by supplier
>
> **Liability Limits (Page 11, Section 9.1):**
> - Limited to 12 months of fees paid
> - Excludes liability for consequential damages
> - Exception: Gross negligence not limited
>
> **Auto-Renewal (Page 12, Section 10.2):**
> - Automatically renews for 1-year terms
> - Must provide 60-day notice to prevent renewal
> - Terms subject to annual price adjustment (max 5%)

**Time saved**: 30+ minutes per document

---

### 3. Compare Multiple Documents
**The situation**: You have 3 proposals, 2 contracts, or multiple versions of the same document. You need to compare them.

**Without AI**: 1-2 hours of side-by-side reading and note-taking
**With AI**: 10 minutes

**How to use AI:**
```
I'm uploading [X] documents: [describe what they are]

Please compare them across these dimensions:
- [Dimension 1]
- [Dimension 2]
- [Dimension 3]

Format as a table with one column per document and a "Winner/Best" column.

Highlight key differences and provide a recommendation.

[upload all documents]
```

**Example:**
```
I'm uploading 3 vendor proposals for our website redesign.

Compare them on:
- Total price
- Timeline (start to completion)
- Included features/scope
- Team experience/portfolio
- Post-launch support
- Payment terms

Create a comparison table and recommend which proposal offers best value.
```

**AI Output:**

| Factor | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C | Best Option |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Price** | $25K | $18K | $32K | Vendor B |
| **Timeline** | 12 weeks | 16 weeks | 10 weeks | Vendor C |
| **Scope** | Full scope + mobile app | Basic scope only | Full scope + SEO | Vendor C |
| **Experience** | 8+ years, 50+ sites | 3 years, 15 sites | 12 years, 100+ sites | Vendor C |
| **Support** | 3 months included | 1 month included | 6 months included | Vendor C |
| **Payment** | 50/50 split | 100% upfront | 33/33/33 milestones | Vendor C |

> **Recommendation**: Vendor C offers best overall value despite higher price. More experienced team, fastest delivery, most comprehensive scope, and best payment terms. Vendor B is cheapest but limited scope and less experience. Vendor A is middle-ground but doesn't excel anywhere.

**Time saved**: 90+ minutes per comparison

### 4. Quality Check Your Writing
**The situation**: You wrote a proposal, report, email, or document. You need to check it for errors, clarity, and impact before sending.

**Without AI**: 15-30 minutes of self-editing (and you still miss things)
**With AI**: 3 minutes

**How to use AI:**
```
I wrote this [document type] for [audience]. Please review it for:

1. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
2. Clarity - any confusing sentences or jargon
3. Tone - is it appropriate for [audience]?
4. Structure - does it flow logically?
5. Impact - is the key message clear?

Provide:
- List of issues found (with line numbers if possible)
- Suggested improvements
- Overall assessment (ready to send or needs work?)

[paste your document]
```

**Example:**
```
I wrote this client proposal for a consulting project. Audience is a Fortune 500 CFO (formal, results-focused).

Check for:
1. Any errors or typos
2. Clarity and conciseness
3. Professional tone (not too casual)
4. Strong structure with clear ROI
5. Any missing elements a CFO would expect

[paste proposal]
```

**AI Output:**
> **Issues Found:**
>
> 1. **Line 12**: "alot" should be "a lot" (or better: "significant")
> 2. **Line 28**: Passive voice ("will be implemented") - change to active ("we will implement")
> 3. **Line 45**: Unclear pronoun reference ("they" - who specifically?)
> 4. **Paragraph 3**: Too casual ("super excited") - change to "pleased to present"
> 5. **Section 2**: Heavy on features, light on ROI - CFO needs financial impact
>
> **Suggested Improvements:**
> - Add executive summary at top (CFOs scan before reading)
> - Include specific cost savings estimates with methodology
> - Break up long paragraphs (especially page 2)
> - Add clear timeline with milestones
> - Strengthen call-to-action at end
>
> **Overall Assessment:**
> Strong foundation but needs revision before sending. Main gaps:
> - Missing financial impact quantification
> - Tone occasionally too casual
> - Structure could be tighter (executive summary, problem, solution, ROI, timeline, next steps)
>
> Recommend 20 minutes of revisions focusing on ROI and tone.

**Time saved**: 20+ minutes and increased quality

### 5. Turn Notes into Polished Documents
**The situation**: You have messy notes from a meeting, brainstorm, or research session. You need a polished document.

**Without AI**: 45-60 minutes of organizing and writing
**With AI**: 10 minutes

**How to use AI:**
```

### 6. Simplify Complex Documents
**The situation**: You have a technical or complex document that needs to be understood by non-experts.

**Without AI**: Hours of rewriting and simplifying
**With AI**: 10 minutes

**How to use AI:**
```
Simplify this document for [target audience who isn't an expert].

Original audience: [current audience]
New audience: [who needs to understand this]

Requirements:
- Remove jargon or define it simply

- Use Claude (more forgiving on file size)

---

### Security: What Docs to Upload

**Safe to upload:**
- Public documents (already available online)
- Anonymized examples
- Your own drafts and working documents
- General industry reports

**Don't upload:**
- Confidential contracts with specific terms
- Customer personal information
- Proprietary financial data
- Anything you wouldn't email to a stranger

**When in doubt**: Redact sensitive info before uploading, or paste text with details removed.

**"What if the AI misses something important?"**
For critical documents (contracts, legal, financial), use AI for first pass then verify key details yourself. AI is great at 80% of the work - you focus on the critical 20%.

**"Can AI understand complex technical documents?"**
Yes, remarkably well. But always verify technical claims if accuracy is critical.

**"Will the AI summary be as good as reading it myself?"**
For most purposes, yes. For deep understanding or critical decisions, use AI summary + selective full reading.

**"Can I upload multiple documents at once?"**
Yes! Both ChatGPT and Claude can handle multiple files in one conversation.
