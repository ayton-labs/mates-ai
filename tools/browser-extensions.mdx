# Browser Extensions for AI

**Coming soon - complete guide to browser extensions for AI workflows.**

**Reality check**: Most aren't necessary. Copy-paste to ChatGPT works fine for 90% of tasks.

## Quick Recommendations

**Actually Worth It:**

**Grammarly** (Writing quality)
- Grammar and spelling everywhere
- Tone suggestions
- Works in email, docs, browsers
- Free version is good, Premium is better

**ChatGPT for Gmail** (If you live in Gmail)
- AI drafts directly in Gmail
- Convenient but not essential

**Worth Skipping:**
- Most "AI assistant" extensions (bloat your browser)
- Extensions that duplicate what ChatGPT already does
- Anything requiring lots of permissions
