## Common Questions

### "Do I really need all these tools?"
**No.** Start with ChatGPT Plus ($20). Add others only when you have a specific need.

### "What's the best value?"
**ChatGPT Plus ($20/month)** covers 70% of needs. Add Perplexity ($20) for research and you're at 90%.

### "When should I pay for specialized tools?"
When you're doing that specific task **daily**. If it's weekly or less, ChatGPT can probably handle it.

### "What about free alternatives?"
Free tiers are great for testing. But if you're using it daily for work, paid tiers save massive time.

### "Can my company pay for these?"
**Yes!** Most have business plans with invoicing. Make the case: "$20/month to save 5 hours/week = massive ROI."

### "What's coming next?"
- More AI integrations in existing tools (Microsoft, Google, Adobe, etc.)
- Better multimodal AI (text + image + video + audio)
- More affordable specialized tools
- Consolidation (tools merging or being acquired)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Start simple:**
1. Get ChatGPT Plus ($20)

**Do:**
- Focus on tools that save hours, not minutes

- Reassess every 3 months
