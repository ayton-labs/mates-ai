## Custom GPTs vs Projects vs Regular Chat

| Feature | Custom GPT | Project | Regular Chat |
|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Reusable** | ✅ Share with team | ❌ Personal only | ❌ One-off |
| **Pre-loaded Knowledge** | ✅ Upload files | ✅ Upload files | ❌ |
| **Custom Instructions** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Per-project | ❌ |
| **Shareable Link** | ✅ Public or private | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Best For** | Team workflows | Personal projects | Quick questions |

**Key Difference**: Custom GPTs are **shareable tools** for your team. Projects are **personal workspaces** for complex tasks.

## Tips for Effective Custom GPTs

**1. Be Specific in Instructions**
- ❌ "Write good emails"
- ✅ "Write sales emails. 100-150 words. Include: pain point, solution, social proof, CTA. Tone: professional but friendly."

**2. Upload Examples, Not Just Guidelines**
- Upload 5-10 real examples of what "good" looks like
- GPT learns patterns from examples better than descriptions

**3. Include "Never Do This" Rules**
- Prevent common mistakes explicitly
- Example: "Never use emojis. Never write subject lines over 50 characters."

**4. Test with Edge Cases**
- Try prompts that might confuse it
- Add clarifications to instructions based on failures

**5. Update Regularly**
- Refresh knowledge files quarterly
- Add new examples as you create great content

## Custom GPT vs Hiring

**When to build a Custom GPT**:
- Repeatable, high-volume tasks
- Need consistency across team
- Clear input → output pattern
- Knowledge is mostly documented

**When to hire a person**:
- Complex judgment calls
- Relationship-building required
- Truly creative work
- Undocumented tribal knowledge

**Best approach**: Custom GPT handles the repetitive 80%, humans handle the strategic 20%

---

## Sharing with Your Team

**ChatGPT (Easiest)**:
1. Build the GPT
2. Set sharing to "Anyone with link"
3. Share link with team (they need ChatGPT Plus)

**Claude (Projects, Not GPTs)**:
- Claude doesn't have shareable custom GPTs yet
- Use Projects for personal workflows
- Share instructions/prompts manually with team

**For Enterprise**:
- ChatGPT Team/Enterprise: Share GPTs org-wide
- Control who can create/use GPTs
- Analytics on GPT usage

OBJECTIVE: Generate personalized cold outreach emails that book meetings

TONE & STYLE:

1. Subject line (5-7 words, personalized)
2. Opening (mention specific trigger or insight)

5. CTA (ask for 15-min call, suggest 2 time slots)

ALWAYS INCLUDE:
- Specific pain point for their industry/role
- Quantified benefit when possible
- Relevant customer name (use uploaded case studies)

NEVER:

- Write paragraphs longer than 2 lines
- Generic benefits like "save time and money"
- Aggressive CTAs like "Let's hop on a call RIGHT NOW"

RESEARCH:
If I provide just a company name, use web browsing to:
- Check their recent news/funding
- Identify likely pain points
- Find personalization hooks

LENGTH: 100-150 words max
```

**3. No Examples**: Just instructions without samples
- Fix: Upload 5-10 real examples

**4. Not Testing**: Build and share without validation
- Fix: Run 20+ test prompts yourself first
