# Custom GPTs

**Coming soon - complete guide to creating custom GPTs.**

## What Are Custom GPTs?

Custom GPTs are specialized versions of ChatGPT that you can create for specific tasks. Think of them as pre-programmed AI assistants.

**Use for:**
- Recurring tasks with specific requirements
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Team workflows
- Shareable AI tools

## Quick Start

1. In ChatGPT, go to "Explore GPTs"
2. Click "Create" in the top right
3. Use the GPT Builder to configure:
   - Name and description
   - Instructions (how it should behave)
   - Knowledge (upload relevant files)
   - Capabilities (web search, image generation, etc.)

## When to Use Custom GPTs vs Projects

**Custom GPTs**: Shareable, public or organization-wide
**Projects**: Personal, private, simpler setup

**For most individual use**: Projects are better
