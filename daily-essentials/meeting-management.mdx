# Stop Losing Track of What Was Decided

**Meetings without clear outcomes are wasted time. AI fixes this.**

Here's how to turn every meeting into actionable results.

---

## The Meeting Problem

**What goes wrong:**
- Meetings end without clear action items
- You forget what was decided by tomorrow
- No one remembers who's doing what
- Notes are messy or incomplete
- Follow-up takes forever
- Same discussions happen repeatedly

**What AI changes:**
- Auto-transcribe meetings with perfect accuracy
- Extract action items automatically
- Generate summaries in 2 minutes
- Create follow-up emails instantly
- Turn discussions into documentation
- Never lose track of decisions

**Time saved**: 30-45 minutes per meeting (prep + follow-up)

---

## The Meeting AI Workflow

### Before the Meeting: Prepare in 5 Minutes

**Use AI for:**
- Creating agendas
- Researching attendees/topics
- Drafting discussion questions
- Preparing briefing materials

**Prompt:**
```
I have a meeting about [topic] with [attendees] on [date].

Purpose: [what you want to accomplish]

Create:
1. A focused agenda (30-45 min meeting)
2. 3-5 key discussion questions
3. Brief on what we should aim to decide/accomplish

Keep it concise and actionable.
```

**Example:**
```
I have a quarterly planning meeting with my team of 6 on Friday.

Purpose: Decide priorities for Q1, assign ownership, set success metrics.

Create:
1. Meeting agenda (45 min)
2. Key questions to drive productive discussion
3. What we should walk away with (decisions and next steps)
```

**AI Output:**
> **Q1 Planning Meeting Agenda** (45 min)
>
> 1. **Review Q4 Results** (5 min)
>    - What worked, what didn't
>    - Key learnings to apply
>
> 2. **Q1 Strategic Priorities** (15 min)
>    - Present proposed priorities (pre-shared)
>    - Discussion and alignment
>    - Finalize top 3 priorities
>
> 3. **Project Ownership & Timelines** (15 min)
>    - Assign DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each priority
>    - Set key milestones and dates
>    - Identify dependencies
>
> 4. **Success Metrics** (8 min)
>    - Define how we'll measure success
>    - Set quarterly targets
>
> 5. **Wrap & Next Steps** (2 min)
>    - Confirm action items
>    - Schedule follow-ups
>
> **Key Discussion Questions:**
> 1. Given our Q4 results and company goals, what should be our #1 focus for Q1?
> 2. What should we stop doing to make room for these priorities?
> 3. What resources or support does each DRI need to succeed?
> 4. What could derail these plans, and how do we mitigate?
> 5. How will we know by end of Q1 if we've succeeded?
>
> **Meeting Success = Walking Away With:**
> - ✅ Agreement on top 3 Q1 priorities (in order)
> - ✅ Clear DRI assigned to each priority
> - ✅ Timeline with key milestones
> - ✅ Defined success metrics for each priority
> - ✅ List of dependencies and who's resolving them
> - ✅ Next check-in scheduled

## Common Questions

**"Do I need to tell people I'm recording?"**
**Yes.** Always disclose when recording. Most tools announce when they join (e.g., "Otter is recording").

**"What if people don't want to be recorded?"**
Respect that. Use AI for your own notes instead. Take rough notes, then clean up with AI after.

**"Can I use this for interviews or performance reviews?"**
Technically yes, but be very careful. Highly sensitive conversations may benefit from human notes over recording.

**"Will people notice I'm using AI for follow-ups?"**
Not unless you tell them. The summaries look like good note-taking, which they are.

**"What about confidential meetings?"**
Don't upload sensitive content to AI. Take your own notes and keep them private.

## Meeting Types That Benefit Most

✅ **Best for AI processing:**

**Time investment**: 5 minutes to set up
**Time saved**: 30-45 minutes per meeting
**Quality improvement**: 100% of decisions and actions captured

*If you have 5 meetings per week, that's 2.5-3.5 hours saved. Every week. Forever.*
