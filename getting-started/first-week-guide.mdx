title: Your First Week with AI
description: Build AI into your daily workflow in 7 days
---

You've used ChatGPT a few times. This guide shows you how to make it part of your daily routine.

**What you'll learn:** Use AI for email, documents, and meetings every day. Build habits that stick.

**Time investment:** 30-60 minutes per day

**Prerequisites:** You've tried ChatGPT or Claude at least once

---

## This Week's Goals

By Day 7:
- Use AI for every email (saves 30-60 min/day)
- Process documents 3x faster
- Never take manual meeting notes again
- Create 2-3 reusable AI workflows
- Try Voice Mode (speak instead of type)

Not for complete beginners - try [Quick Wins](../resources/quick-wins) first if you haven't used AI before.

---

## Before You Start (10 minutes)

### Upgrade Your Setup

**If you're still on free tier:**
- [ ] Consider upgrading to ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) - worth it if you use AI 3+ times/week
- [ ] Or try Claude Pro if you work with long documents
- [ ] Why upgrade? Faster responses, better models, priority access, **better privacy**

**Get the mobile app:**
- [ ] Download ChatGPT app (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Enable [**Voice Mode**](../guides/voice-mode-tricks) - this changes everything ðŸŽ¤
- [ ] Sign in and test voice mode now

**ðŸŽ¤ Critical Insight**: Throughout this week, use [Voice Mode](../guides/voice-mode-tricks) instead of typing whenever possible. It's 3-4x faster and gets better results. This alone will transform your experience.

---

## Day 1: Email AI Habit

Use AI for every email today.

### Morning (30 min)

**The workflow:**

```
I received: [paste email]

Write a response that:
- [What you want to accomplish]
- Tone: [professional/casual/firm]
- Length: [50/100/150 words]
- Include: [specific points to address]

Format as ready-to-send (don't explain, just draft).
```

3. **Voice Mode version** (3x faster):
   - Open ChatGPT app
   - Press voice mode
   - Say: "I got an email about [topic], help me write a response that [what you want]"
   - Speak naturally, get instant draft

### Afternoon: Advanced Email Techniques (20 min)

**Try these upgrades:**

**Difficult conversations:**
```
I need to tell [person] that [bad news/no/pushback].

Write an email that:
- Delivers the message clearly but kindly
- Provides brief rationale
- Offers alternative/next steps
- Maintains relationship
- Under 150 words
```

**Email templates for recurring scenarios:**
```
Create an email template I can reuse for:
[Describe recurring scenario - client updates, meeting requests, etc.]

Include [placeholders] I can customize each time.
Make it professional but warm.
```

**Save your best prompts** - you'll use them daily from now on.

### Evening: Measure Impact

**Calculate**: How many emails did you write today with AI? How much time saved?

**Goal for tomorrow**: Use AI for 100% of emails (yes, even quick ones).

## Day 2 (Tuesday): Document Processing at Scale

**You've summarized one document with AI. Now process everything.**

### Morning: Upload Everything (45 min)

**Today's challenge**: Don't read ANY document manually.

**For each document that hits your inbox:**

1. **Upload to Claude** (better for long docs) or ChatGPT Plus
2. **Start with this prompt:**

```
This document: what do I need to know?

Provide:
1. Topic (one sentence)
2. Why it matters (2 sentences)
3. Key points (5 bullets)
4. Action required from me (if any)
5. Deadline (if mentioned)

Be specific. Include numbers and dates.
```

**Advanced move**: Ask follow-up questions
- "What's the risk if we don't do X?"
- "Compare this to our current approach"
- "What's missing from this proposal?"

### Afternoon: Extraction & Analysis (30 min)

**Go beyond summaries:**

**Extract structured data:**
```
From this document, create a table with:
- [Column 1]: [What to extract]
- [Column 2]: [What to extract]
- [Column 3]: [What to extract]

Include page numbers for each item.
```

**Compare multiple documents:**
```
I'm uploading 3 proposals. Compare them on:
- Price
- Timeline
- Scope
- Key differences
- Recommendation

Create comparison table.
```

**Evening reflection**: How many hours of reading did AI handle today?

**[Deep dive: Document Processing Guide â†’](../daily-essentials/document-processing)**

## Day 3 (Wednesday): Meeting Management System

**You've used AI for one meeting's notes. Now automate all meetings.**

### Morning: Sign Up for AI Note-Taking (15 min)

**Stop taking manual notes**:
- **Fathom** (best for Zoom sales calls) - Free
- **Otter.ai** (best all-around) - Free tier available
- **Granola** (best for hybrid manual + AI) - Mac only

**Set up today**, use in your next meeting.

### Before Every Meeting: AI Agenda (5 min)

```
Meeting with [who] about [topic] for [duration].

Our goals:
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]

Create agenda with:
- Time blocks
- Key questions to ask
- Decisions to make
```

### After Every Meeting: Instant Follow-Up (10 min)

**If using AI note-taker**: Paste transcript

**If manual notes**: Paste your notes

```
Turn these meeting notes into:

1. **Summary** (3 sentences - what happened)
2. **Decisions** (what we decided)
3. **Action Items**:
   | Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority |
4. **Next Steps** (what happens next)

Format as email ready to send to attendees.
```

**Voice Mode trick**: Immediately after meeting, speak your recollection to ChatGPT voice mode while it's fresh. Get instant structured notes.

**Today's goal**: Use this for EVERY meeting.

**[Deep dive: Meeting Management Guide â†’](../daily-essentials/meeting-management)**

## Day 4 (Thursday): The Voice Mode Revolution

**This is the day everything changes.**

### All-Day Challenge: Voice Only

**Rule for today**: Only use AI through voice mode. No typing.

**Why**: Voice is:
- 3-4x faster than typing
- More natural (better results)
- Hands-free (work while walking/commuting)
- Better for complex thoughts

### Morning Setup (5 min)

1. Open ChatGPT mobile app
2. Enable voice mode
3. Test: "Help me prioritize my day. I need to [list your tasks]. What order makes most sense?"

### Use Voice Mode For:

**Email** (speak the email context, get instant drafts)

**Brainstorming** (think out loud, AI organizes ideas)

**Problem-solving** ("I'm stuck on [problem], help me think through it")

**Learning** ("Explain [concept] like I'm not an expert")

**Planning** ("I need to plan [event/project], what should I consider?")

### The Full-Circle Method (Game-Changer)

**Instead of struggling to write perfect prompts:**

Say: "I need help writing a prompt for [task I want to accomplish]"

ChatGPT will design the perfect prompt for you, then you can use it together.

**This is the secret nobody tells you.**

**Evening reflection**: How much faster was today vs typing?

## Common Week 1 Challenges & Solutions

### "I keep forgetting to use it"
**Solution**:
- Sticky note on monitor: "Try AI first"
- Set hourly reminder on phone for 3 days
- Make it harder to do things manually (close email, open ChatGPT first)

### "Results still aren't great"
**Solution**:
- Add more context to prompts (who, what, why, tone, length)
- Use Voice Mode - you naturally give better context when speaking
- Try [Prompt Writing Guide](../getting-started/prompt-writing-guide)

### "It's actually slower sometimes"
**Solution**:
- Normal in week 1! Speed comes from:
  - Saved prompts (no rewriting)
  - Projects (context already loaded)
  - Voice mode (3x faster input)
- By week 2-3, you'll be way faster

### "I don't know when to use AI vs do it myself"
**Solution**:
- Default to AI first, manual only if AI fails
- Use AI for: first drafts, research, analysis, summaries, organization
- Do yourself: final decisions, relationship-critical work, strategy

### "Privacy concerns holding me back"
**Solution**:
- Upgrade to Plus/Pro (data not used for training)
- Anonymize sensitive info before pasting
- Read [Security & Pricing Guide](../security/security-and-pricing)
