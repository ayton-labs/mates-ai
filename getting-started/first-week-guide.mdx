## Week 1 Success Metrics

### You're succeeding if you:
✅ Used AI at least once per day
✅ Saved 30+ minutes daily
✅ Created at least one habit (e.g., AI for all email responses)
✅ Feel more confident using AI
✅ Can explain one technique to a colleague

### Don't worry if:
- You didn't try everything (that's fine!)
- Some results were mediocre (iteration is key)
- You're still figuring things out (everyone is)
- You forgot to use AI sometimes (build the habit slowly)

---

## Week 2 and Beyond

### Week 2: Deepen Your Practice
- Use AI automatically for email, docs, meetings
- Try one advanced guide (Projects, Deep Research, etc.)
- Explore specialized tools if needed
- Help a colleague get started

### Week 3: Optimize Your Workflow
- Build 2-3 Projects for recurring tasks
- Create text expansion shortcuts for common prompts
- Integrate transcription tools for meetings
- Track ROI (hours saved = money saved)

### Month 2+: Advanced Techniques
- Custom GPTs (if applicable)
- API integrations (for power users)
- Automation with Zapier/Make
- Build team-wide AI practices

## Common Week 1 Challenges

### "I keep forgetting to use it"
**Solution**: Put a sticky note on your monitor: "Try AI first"

### "Results aren't good enough"
**Solution**: Read [Prompt Writing Guide](../getting-started/prompt-writing-guide) and add more specifics

### "I'm not sure when to use it"
**Solution**: Use our [Quick Wins](../resources/quick-wins) - concrete use cases

### "It's slower than doing it myself"
**Solution**: Normal at first! By week 2, you'll be faster. Voice mode helps.

### "I'm worried about privacy"
**Solution**: Read [Security & Privacy section](../getting-started/prompt-writing-guide#security--privacy-what-to-share-and-not-share)

## Your Week 1 Commitment

**The deal**: Try AI for real work every day this week. If it doesn't save time by Day 7, you can quit.

**But here's what will actually happen**: By Day 3, you'll wonder how you lived without it.

---

## Ready to Start?

**Right now** (next 5 minutes):
1. Sign up for ChatGPT if you haven't
2. Try Quick Win #1: Respond to one email using AI
3. Note the time saved
4. Come back tomorrow for Day 2

**Start tomorrow** (Monday is ideal):
- Fresh week, fresh start
- Easier to build daily habits
- Full week to see results

**Either way**: Just start. Don't wait for the "perfect time."

---

**Remember**: Everyone who's good at this started exactly where you are. The only difference is they started.

**Today is Day 1. Let's go.**
