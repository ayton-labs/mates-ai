## Pro Tips for Sales

**Build your Sales Assistant Project:**

Upload to [ChatGPT Project](../guides/chatgpt-projects):
- Your product one-pager and positioning
- Case studies and customer testimonials
- Pricing and packaging details
- Common objection responses
- Competitive intelligence

Then every prompt gets this context automatically.

**Voice Mode for sales calls:**
- During drive between meetings: dictate follow-up emails
- Pre-call: "Remind me of key questions for [prospect] discovery"
- Post-call: "Turn these notes into next steps and follow-up"

**Best practices:**
- Personalize every AI output (add one custom sentence)
- Use AI for structure and speed, your knowledge for positioning
- Track which prompts convert best (iterate on winners)
- Never share prospect confidential info (use "Company A" instead of real names)

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Sending AI-generated emails without personalization** (add one specific reference to their business)

❌ **Generic value props** (customize to their industry/role/pain point)

❌ **Not fact-checking competitive claims** (verify before using in sales conversation)

❌ **Over-relying on AI for objection handling** (use as framework, add your experience)

❌ **Forgetting to update AI context** (tell it about recent product updates, new case studies)
