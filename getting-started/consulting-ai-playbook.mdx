## Pro Tips for Consultants

**Build your Consulting Project:**

Upload to [ChatGPT Project](../guides/chatgpt-projects):
- Your standard frameworks (McKinsey pyramids, BCG matrices, etc.)
- Client background and context
- Industry research and benchmarks
- Past deliverable examples (anonymized)
- Your firm's methodology and approach

**Voice Mode for consulting:**
- Post-client meeting: Immediately dictate key takeaways
- Research synthesis: Speak your thoughts as you read sources
- Deck preparation: Talk through slide logic before building

**Best practices:**
- Use AI for structure and first draft speed
- Add your strategic insight and client-specific nuance
- Fact-check all data and claims before client presentation
- Keep client confidential info anonymized in prompts
- Build a library of your best outputs to improve prompts over time

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Generic recommendations** (make them specific to client's industry, size, situation)

❌ **Jargon overload** (AI loves fancy words - simplify for client audience)

❌ **Not connecting insights to client decisions** (always answer "so what?")

❌ **Forgetting caveats and limitations** (consultants need intellectual honesty)

❌ **Copy-pasting without strategic review** (AI doesn't know your client like you do)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try one prompt this week**: Start with #5 for your next status update
2. **Build your library**: Save best prompts and successful outputs
3. **Create Consulting Project**: Upload frameworks and client context once
4. **Share with team**: Scale best practices across your firm
