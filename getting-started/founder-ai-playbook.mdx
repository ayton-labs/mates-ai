## Common Mistakes

❌ **Generic investor outreach** (research each investor, personalize opening)

❌ **Sugar-coating challenges in updates** (investors respect transparency)

❌ **Not prioritizing ruthlessly** (founders say yes to too much - use AI to force choices)

❌ **Hiring JDs that sound like every other startup** (show your unique culture and mission)

❌ **Product strategy that's too generic** (have an opinion, make tough calls)

## Next Steps

1. **Try one prompt this week**: Start with #4 for your next investor update
2. **Build your Founder Project**: Upload company context for faster outputs
3. **Save your wins**: Keep best prompts and outputs in a library
4. **Share with co-founders**: Align on voice and messaging
