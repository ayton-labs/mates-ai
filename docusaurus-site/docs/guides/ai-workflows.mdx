title: AI Workflows
description: Pre-built multi-step workflows for complex tasks
---

**Stop using AI for one-off tasks. Build repeatable workflows that handle entire processes.**

Most people use AI reactively - "help me with this email" or "summarize this doc." Power users build **workflows** - sequences of AI tasks that automate entire processes from start to finish.

---

## What Are AI Workflows?

**Single task**: "Help me write this email"

**Workflow**: "Every time I get a proposal request → Research company → Draft proposal → Create pricing → Write follow-up sequence"

**The difference**: Workflows turn AI from a helper into a system.

---

## When to Build Workflows

✅ You do the same type of complex task weekly/monthly

✅ The task has multiple steps that could each use AI

✅ You want consistent quality every time

✅ You're willing to invest 30 min upfront to save hours later

**Examples**: Client onboarding, weekly reporting, deal preparation, monthly analysis, content production

## How to Build Your Own Workflows

### 1. Identify Repetitive Complex Tasks
Ask: "What do I do monthly/weekly that has 3+ steps and takes 2+ hours?"

Examples:
- Client reporting
- Sales pipeline review
- Hiring process
- Event planning
- Partnership outreach

### 2. Break Into AI-Friendly Steps
For each step, ask: "Could AI help with this?"

**Good for AI**: Research, writing, analysis, formatting, idea generation
**Keep human**: Final decisions, relationship work, strategy, review

### 3. Build the Workflow
- Write prompts for each step
- Test with real example
- Refine based on output quality
- Save prompts in ChatGPT Project or doc

### 4. Document & Reuse
Create a workflow doc:
```
Workflow Name: [X]
Time saved: [Y hours]
Frequency: [weekly/monthly]

Step 1: [Task] - [Prompt]
Step 2: [Task] - [Prompt]
...

Tips:
- [Specific guidance]
- [Common pitfalls]
```

### 5. Train Others
Share workflows with team. One person builds it, everyone benefits.

## Best Practices

**Do:**
✅ Build workflows for tasks you do 3+ times
✅ Test each step before automating the full workflow
✅ Save successful prompts in ChatGPT Projects
✅ Train team members on your best workflows
✅ Iterate - workflows improve with use

**Don't:**
❌ Over-automate - some things need human touch
❌ Skip review steps - always check AI outputs
❌ Make workflows too rigid - leave room for customization
❌ Forget to measure time saved
❌ Build workflows for one-off tasks

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Building workflows without testing individual prompts first**
Start with one step, perfect it, then chain together.

❌ **Not documenting the workflow**
You'll forget the prompts. Save them somewhere.

❌ **Trying to automate everything at once**
Start with one high-value workflow, master it, then expand.

❌ **Forgetting the human review step**
AI workflows still need human judgment at key points.

❌ **Not sharing workflows with team**
Biggest ROI is when 5 people save 2 hours each.

---

## Measuring Success

**Track these metrics:**
- Time before workflow: [X hours]
- Time with workflow: [Y hours]
- Time saved per execution: [Z hours]
- Frequency: [weekly/monthly]
- Annual time saved: [Z × frequency]
- Team members using it: [number]
- Total team time saved: [individual savings × team size]

**Example:**
- Monthly client reporting: 3 hours → 45 min
- Saves: 2.25 hours per month
- Frequency: Monthly
- Annual savings: 27 hours
- Team size: 4 people
- Total annual savings: 108 hours (2.7 work weeks)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Pick one workflow** from this guide that matches your work
2. **Test it end-to-end** with a real example this week
3. **Document what works** (save prompts, note refinements)
4. **Share with team** (demo the time savings)
5. **Build your second workflow** next month

**The goal**: Build a library of 3-5 workflows that save you 5-10 hours/week.

**Related guides:**
- [ChatGPT Projects](./chatgpt-projects) - Best way to save workflow prompts
- [Prompt Library](../prompts/overview) - Individual prompts to build workflows
- [Voice Mode](./voice-mode-tricks) - Run workflows faster with voice

---

**Workflows compound**: Build once, use forever. The best investment is the first 30 minutes documenting a workflow you'll use 50 times.
