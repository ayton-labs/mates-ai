**Define success:**
- "Good outcome looks like [specific result]"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too generic** - Add specific team/company context for better outputs

❌ **No implementation plan** - Ask how to roll out the process/change

❌ **Missing stakeholders** - Identify who needs to be involved/informed

❌ **Unrealistic timelines** - Factor in actual capacity and constraints

❌ **Over-complicating** - Simplest solution is usually best

## Next Steps

1. **Start with documentation** - Pick your most chaotic process and create an SOP
2. **Template everything** - Build prompts for recurring tasks (reviews, agendas, etc.)
3. **Delegate with AI** - Use AI to draft, then human to approve/refine
4. **Measure impact** - Track time saved on routine admin tasks
5. **Build a library** - Save your best operations prompts for reuse

**Pro tip**: Create a "Team Operations" ChatGPT Project with your org chart, common processes, and company values pre-loaded. Every operational output will be contextually relevant.
