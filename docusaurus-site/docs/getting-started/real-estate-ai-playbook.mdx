## Real-World Workflow

**Morning routine (30 min with AI vs 90 min without):**
1. Check overnight inquiries → Use prompt #2 for each (5 min total)
2. New listing going live → Use prompt #1 (10 min)
3. Client wants CMA → Use prompt #3 (15 min)

**During showings (via Voice Mode):**
- Client asks about property → Speak to ChatGPT, get instant analysis (prompt #5)
- Objection comes up → Quick voice prompt #6 for talking points

**After open house:**
- Batch all follow-ups with prompt #4 (20 min for 20 people)

**Weekly time saved: 8-12 hours**

## Pro Tips for Real Estate

**Upload once, reuse forever:**
- Your standard bio and credentials
- Neighborhood guides and school info
- Common disclosure language
- Your brokerage's standard terms

Save these in a [ChatGPT Project](../guides/chatgpt-projects) called "Real Estate Assistant"

**Voice Mode is game-changing when:**
- Driving between showings (dictate property notes)
- At open house (quick lookups while talking to buyers)
- Evening follow-up calls (speak email drafts instead of typing)

**Best practices:**
- Always fact-check property details and prices
- Personalize AI outputs before sending (add your voice)
- Use AI for first draft, your expertise for final decision
- Never share client confidential info in prompts (use "Client A" instead of names)

## Common Mistakes

❌ Using generic property descriptions (add neighborhood personality and lifestyle benefits)

❌ Not customizing email templates (add one personal sentence per client)

❌ Forgetting to verify comps and dates (AI can hallucinate numbers)

❌ Over-relying on AI for pricing strategy (use it to draft, your expertise to decide)
