---

**Stop spending days in Excel. Build financial models in hours.**

AI can help you create budgets, forecast revenue, model scenarios, analyze profitability, and explain complex financial concepts - without being a finance expert.

---

## Use Case #1: Annual Budget Planning

**Problem**: Building budgets from scratch takes weeks and endless revisions.

**AI Solution**: Draft comprehensive budgets in 2-3 hours.

**Prompt:**
```
Help me create an annual budget for [department/company] for [year].

Current baseline (last year's actuals):
- Revenue: [$amount]
- Expenses by category:
  - Payroll: [$amount]
  - Marketing: [$amount]
  - Software/tools: [$amount]
  - Office/facilities: [$amount]
  - Other: [$amount]

Growth assumptions for next year:
- Revenue growth: [%]
- Headcount additions: [number of hires]
- New initiatives: [list]

Create a detailed budget with:

1. **Revenue projections** (by month, by product/service if applicable)
2. **Expense categories** with monthly breakdown
3. **Headcount plan** (when to hire, fully-loaded costs)
4. **One-time vs recurring expenses**
5. **Key assumptions documented**
6. **Profitability by quarter**
7. **Cash flow implications**

Present as Excel-ready format with formulas explained.
```

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Now create 3 scenarios:
- **Conservative** (10% lower revenue)
- **Base case** (our plan)
- **Aggressive** (20% higher revenue)

For each scenario, show:
- Revenue
- Key expense adjustments
- Profitability
- When we'd need to adjust hiring

Present as scenario comparison table.
```

**Time saved**: 6-8 hours of budget modeling

## Use Case #2: Revenue Forecasting

**Problem**: Forecasting revenue requires analyzing historical trends and making assumptions.

**AI Solution**: Build forecasts in 45 minutes.

**Prompt:**
```
Create a revenue forecast for [time period].

Historical data (paste your data):
[Month/Quarter | Revenue | # Customers | Avg Deal Size | etc.]

Or describe trends:
- Last 12 months growth rate: [%]
- Seasonality patterns: [description]
- Recent changes: [new products, market shifts, etc.]

Assumptions:
- Expected growth rate: [%]
- New products launching: [when, expected revenue]
- Sales team expansion: [when, ramp time]
- Market conditions: [headwinds or tailwinds]

Create forecast showing:
1. **Monthly revenue projection**
2. **Confidence intervals** (best/worst/likely)
3. **Key drivers** (what needs to happen to hit forecast)
4. **Sensitivity analysis** (impact of 10% miss on key assumptions)
5. **Leading indicators to track**

Explain methodology and show your work.
```

**Output example:**
```
**Revenue Forecast: Q1-Q4 2025**

| Month | Conservative | Base Case | Aggressive |
|-------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Jan | $450K | $500K | $550K |
| Feb | $470K | $525K | $580K |
...

**Key Assumptions:**
1. 5% month-over-month growth (based on 12-month average)
2. New product adds $50K/month starting Q2
3. 2 new AEs ramp in Q3 ($75K/month when fully ramped)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- If growth rate is 3% instead of 5%: -$120K by year-end
- If new product delays 1 quarter: -$300K
- If AE ramp takes 2 months longer: -$150K

**Leading Indicators:**
- Pipeline coverage (need 3x to hit forecast)
- Win rate (need to maintain 25%+)
- Average deal size (assume $15K, watch for drift)
```

**Time saved**: 2-3 hours of modeling

**Pro tip**: Upload your Excel historical data for more accurate forecasts

Total fixed: $X

Variable costs (per unit/customer):
- [Cost 1]: $X
- [Cost 2]: $X
Total variable per unit: $X

Calculate:
1. **Break-even point** (units and dollars)
2. **Break-even timeline** (assuming [X] units/month ramp)
3. **Payback period**
4. **Scenario analysis**:
   - If revenue is 20% lower

- Sales cost (CAC): $X
- Total cost to serve: $X

Market context:
- Competitor pricing: [range]

2. **Value-based pricing** (based on value delivered)
3. **Competitive pricing** (based on market rates)
4. **Psychological pricing** (optimal price points)

For each approach, show:

## Best Practices

**Do:**
✅ Verify AI calculations (spot-check formulas)
✅ Document assumptions clearly
✅ Use AI for first draft, refine with domain knowledge
✅ Test sensitivity of key assumptions
✅ Keep historical data for AI to learn patterns

**Don't:**
❌ Blindly trust AI math (always verify)
❌ Share confidential financial data (use fake numbers to test)
❌ Use AI outputs without understanding methodology
❌ Forget to update assumptions as business changes
❌ Skip human review of strategic financial decisions

---

## Tools & Setup

**Best AI for financial modeling:**
- **ChatGPT Plus/Pro**: Best for calculations and Excel formula help
- **Claude Pro**: Better for analyzing complex financial documents
- **Excel + AI**: Use AI to write formulas, you verify in Excel

**Also useful:**
- **Google Sheets**: Can paste AI outputs directly
- **Python**: For more complex modeling (AI can write the code)

**Upgrade worth it?**
- Yes if you do financial modeling monthly
- Advanced data analysis features save hours
- Can upload Excel files directly

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Not verifying AI calculations** - Always spot-check math

❌ **Overly precise forecasts** - AI gives exact numbers, but business is uncertain

❌ **Forgetting to document assumptions** - Future you will need to know why

❌ **Using AI for GAAP compliance** - Get a real accountant for official reporting

❌ **Not stress-testing** - Always model downside scenarios
