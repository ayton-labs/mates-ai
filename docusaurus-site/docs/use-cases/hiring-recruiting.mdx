**Stop spending weeks on hiring. Use AI to find the right people faster.**

AI can handle 70% of the repetitive hiring work - writing job posts, screening candidates, preparing interviews, and evaluating responses.

---

## Use Case #1: Writing Job Descriptions

**Problem**: Job descriptions take 2-3 hours to write and often sound generic.

**AI Solution**: Draft compelling JDs in 15 minutes.

**Prompt:**
```
Write a job description for [role title].

Context:
- Team: [department, size]
- Reports to: [role]
- Why we're hiring: [growth/backfill/new function]
- Location: [remote/hybrid/office]

Key responsibilities:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

Required skills:
- [Must-have 1]
- [Must-have 2]

Nice-to-have:
- [Preferred 1]
- [Preferred 2]

About us: [2-3 sentence company description]

Create a compelling job description with:
1. Opening hook (why this role matters)
2. What you'll do (impact-focused, not task lists)
3. What you'll bring (skills & experience)
4. What we offer (growth, culture, benefits)
5. How to apply

Tone: Exciting but realistic. Sell the opportunity, not just requirements.
Length: 400-600 words
```

**Time saved**: 90 minutes per job post

**Pro tip**: Upload 2-3 of your best job descriptions first and say "Write in this style"

## Use Case #2: Resume Screening

**Problem**: Reviewing 100+ resumes takes days and you might miss good candidates.

**AI Solution**: Screen and rank candidates in 30 minutes.

**How to do it:**

1. **Export resumes** to a folder (PDF or text)
2. **Upload to ChatGPT or Claude** (can handle multiple files)
3. **Use this prompt:**

```
I'm hiring for [role]. Here are the must-have qualifications:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Nice-to-have:
- [Preference 1]
- [Preference 2]

Review these resumes and create a ranked list:

**Top Tier** (Strong match - interview immediately)
- Name
- Why they're a strong fit (2-3 key points)
- Potential concerns (if any)

**Maybe Tier** (Worth considering if top tier doesn't work out)
- Name
- Pros and cons

**Pass Tier** (Don't meet requirements)
- Name
- Missing qualification

Focus on actual qualifications and experience, not just keywords.
```

**Time saved**: 4-5 hours of screening

**Warning**: Always do human review of "Top Tier" - AI can miss context or red flags

## Use Case #3: Interview Question Generator

**Problem**: Generic interview questions don't reveal how candidates actually think.

**AI Solution**: Generate role-specific behavioral questions in 10 minutes.

**Prompt:**
```
Create interview questions for [role title].

Focus areas:
- [Core skill 1]
- [Core skill 2]
- [Core skill 3]

For each focus area, provide:
1. 2-3 behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when...")
2. What to listen for in good vs great answers
3. Follow-up questions to dig deeper
4. Red flags to watch for

Also include:
- Opening questions (build rapport)
- Situational questions (how would you handle X scenario)
- Culture fit assessment questions
- Questions to ask about their questions for us

Format as an interview guide with scoring rubric.
```

**Output example:**
```
**Technical Problem-Solving:**

Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex technical
problem with limited resources or information. Walk me through your approach."

Good answer includes:
- Specific situation with context
- Clear problem-solving process
- Resourcefulness
- Outcome and learning

Great answer also shows:
- How they knew when they didn't know
- Who they asked for help and why
- Trade-offs they considered
- How they'd approach it differently now

Follow-ups:
- "What would you do differently knowing what you know now?"
- "How did you validate your solution was the right one?"
- "What did you learn from this that you've applied since?"

Red flags:
- Vague or generic examples
- No mention of learning or iteration
- Blaming others for constraints
- Can't articulate their thought process
```

**Time saved**: 45 minutes of prep per interview

## Best Practices

**Do:**
✅ Use AI for first drafts, then personalize

✅ Use AI to reduce bias (objective criteria)
✅ Save your best prompts as templates

**Don't:**
❌ Rely solely on AI for resume screening
❌ Use generic AI outputs without review
❌ Share candidate personal info with AI (use "Candidate A")
❌ Let AI make final hiring decisions
❌ Use AI-generated rejection letters without personalization

---

## Tools & Setup

**Best AI for hiring:**
- **ChatGPT Plus/Team**: Best for generating content (JDs, questions, offers)
- **Claude Pro**: Better for analyzing long resumes and documents
- **Gemini**: Good for research on market rates and comp

**Upgrade worth it?**
- Yes if hiring 3+ people per year
- Team plan if multiple hiring managers
- ROI: One good hire pays for years of AI tools

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Using AI to write generic job posts** - Give it specific context and examples

❌ **Not reviewing AI resume screens** - AI misses context, always human-review top picks

❌ **Copy-pasting AI interview questions** - Customize to your company and role

❌ **Forgetting to anonymize** - Don't share candidate PII with AI, use placeholders
