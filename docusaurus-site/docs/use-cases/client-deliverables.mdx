description: Reports, presentations, proposals - deliver faster and better
---

**Stop spending weekends on client work. Deliver faster without sacrificing quality.**

AI can help you create reports, presentations, proposals, executive summaries, and recommendations - the high-stakes deliverables that clients pay for.

---

## Use Case #1: Executive Summary (The Critical 1-Page)

**Problem**: Executives want the whole story in one page. Crafting that takes hours.

**AI Solution**: Polished executive summaries in 15 minutes.

**Prompt:**
```
Create an executive summary for [project/report name].

Full context (paste or summarize):
- Project background: [why we did this]
- Methodology: [how we approached it]
- Key findings: [main discoveries]
- Recommendations: [what to do]
- Data/evidence: [supporting facts]

Create a 1-page executive summary that includes:

1. **Situation** (2-3 sentences)
   - Why this matters
   - What problem we're solving

2. **Key Findings** (3-5 bullets)
   - Most important discoveries
   - Quantified where possible
   - Surprising insights highlighted

3. **Recommendations** (3-4 bullets)
   - Specific actions
   - Prioritized (what to do first)
   - Timeline if applicable

4. **Impact** (2-3 sentences)
   - Expected outcomes
   - ROI or benefits
   - Risks of inaction

Tone: Confident, clear, executive-level
Length: 350-400 words (fits on one page)
Format: Scannable bullets, bold key points
```

**Time saved**: 60 minutes of distillation and writing

**Pro tip**: Use [Voice Mode](../guides/voice-mode-tricks) to explain your findings first, then ask AI to structure it

---

## Use Case #2: Client Presentation Deck

**Problem**: Building client presentations from scratch takes 6-8 hours.

Context and findings:
[Paste project summary, data, insights]

Create slide-by-slide outline:

For each slide, provide:
1. **Slide title** (clear, benefit-focused)
2. **Key message** (the headline)
3. **Supporting points** (3-4 bullets)
4. **Data/visual needed** (chart, table, image)
5. **Talking points** (what to say, not what's on slide)

Structure:
- Opening: Hook + agenda (1-2 slides)
- Situation: Context + problem (2-3 slides)
- Analysis: Findings + data (5-7 slides)
- Recommendations: What to do (3-4 slides)
- Next steps: Action plan (1-2 slides)
- Appendix: Supporting detail (as needed)

Make it story-driven, not data-dump. Each slide should flow to the next.
```

**Follow-up for slide content:**
```
For slide [number]: [title], write the full slide content.

Include:
- Headline (the takeaway)
- 3-4 bullet points (keep each under 10 words)
- Chart description (what data to visualize and how)

## Best Practices for Client Deliverables

**Do:**
✅ Use AI for structure and first drafts
✅ Always personalize with client-specific context
✅ Add your expertise and insights AI can't provide
✅ Review for accuracy and tone before sending
✅ Keep client confidential info safe (anonymize for AI)

**Don't:**
❌ Send AI outputs without thorough review
❌ Use generic AI content without customization
❌ Share sensitive client data in prompts
❌ Let AI replace your strategic thinking
❌ Forget to add examples and context

---

## Quality Checklist

Before sending client deliverables created with AI:

- [ ] Factually accurate (verified data and claims)
- [ ] Client-specific (not generic consulting-speak)
- [ ] Actionable (client knows what to do next)
- [ ] Professional (proper formatting, no errors)
- [ ] Strategic (shows expertise, not just AI output)
- [ ] Clear (executive could understand in 5 minutes)
- [ ] Branded (follows your firm's standards)

---

## Tools & Setup

**Best AI for client deliverables:**
- **ChatGPT Plus/Team**: Great for reports and proposals
- **Claude Pro**: Better for long documents and nuanced writing
- **Both**: Use ChatGPT for structure, Claude for refinement

**Also useful:**
- **Grammarly**: Final polish on writing
- **Hemingway Editor**: Simplify complex sentences
- **Canva/Beautiful.ai**: Turn AI content into slides

**Upgrade worth it?**
Absolutely. If you bill clients hourly, AI tools pay for themselves in one project.

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Sending first draft from AI** - Always review and personalize

❌ **Generic consultant-speak** - Add client-specific examples and context

❌ **Not validating data** - AI can hallucinate numbers - verify everything

❌ **Forgetting client voice** - Match their communication style and priorities

❌ **Over-relying on AI** - Your expertise and judgment are what clients pay for

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with low-stakes deliverable**: Try AI for your next status report (20 min)
2. **Build templates**: Save your best prompts for recurring deliverables
3. **Get feedback**: Ask colleagues to review AI-assisted work
4. **Level up**: Once comfortable, tackle bigger deliverables (proposals, reports)
5. **Track time saved**: Measure hours saved to justify AI investment

**Related guides:**
- [Content Creation Prompts](../prompts/content-creation) - More templates for deliverables
- [Voice Mode Tricks](../guides/voice-mode-tricks) - Faster way to explain context to AI
- [ChatGPT Projects](../guides/chatgpt-projects) - Save client context for ongoing work
- [Data Privacy](../security/security-and-pricing) - Protecting client confidential information

---

**Remember**: AI creates the scaffolding. Your expertise, client knowledge, and strategic thinking make it valuable. Use AI to save time on structure and writing so you can focus on insights and recommendations clients actually pay for.
