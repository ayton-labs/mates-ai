# Data Privacy & Security with AI

**Use AI safely. Know the rules.**

AI tools are powerful, but you need to be smart about what you share. Here's everything you need to know.

---

## The Golden Rule

**Ask yourself**: "Would I email this to a stranger?"

- **If NO** → Don't put it in AI
- **If YES** → Generally safe to use

---

## What NOT to Share

### ❌ Never Share

**Customer Personal Information:**
- Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Payment details or financial information
- Personal health information
- Social security numbers or IDs

**Company Confidential:**
- Complete financial statements (exact numbers)
- Proprietary algorithms or IP
- Unreleased product plans (pre-launch specifics)
- Confidential contracts (exact terms and pricing)
- Employee personal information (salaries, reviews)

**Security Sensitive:**
- Passwords, API keys, credentials
- Internal system access details
- Security vulnerabilities

---

## What IS Safe to Share

### ✅ Generally Safe

**Anonymized Examples:**
- "A customer spent $5000" (not "John Smith spent $5000")
- "We have a supplier contract" (not the full contract with terms)

**Public Information:**
- Competitor websites and public content
- Published articles and reports
- Your own marketing materials

**Your Own Work:**
- Email drafts you're writing
- Documents you're creating
- Your meeting notes (without PII)

**General Scenarios:**
- "A customer is unhappy about a delay..."
- "I need to analyze sales trends..."
- "Help me structure a proposal..."

## Account Types & Privacy

### Free Accounts (ChatGPT, Claude)
**Privacy level**: Lower

- Data may be used for training
- Less privacy guarantees
- Use for: Personal, non-sensitive work

### Paid Accounts (Plus, Pro)
**Privacy level**: Better

- Your conversations DON'T train the model (as of 2025)
- Better security features
- Enhanced privacy protections
- Use for: Professional work with precautions

### Business/Enterprise Accounts
**Privacy level**: Highest

- Strongest privacy guarantees
- Admin controls and audit logs
- Compliance features (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.)
- Dedicated support
- Use for: Company-wide deployment

**Recommendation**: If you're doing regular work tasks, upgrade to Plus/Pro ($20/month). The privacy improvement is worth it.

## How to Anonymize Information

### Technique 1: Remove Identifiers
**Before**: "Sarah Johnson at TechCorp (sarah.j@techcorp.com) bought $50K of software"
**After**: "A customer at a mid-size tech company bought $50K of software"

### Technique 2: Use Placeholders
**Before**: [Full contract with Company XYZ, $500K/year, specific terms]
**After**: "I have a contract with key sections: pricing, delivery timeline, cancellation terms. Help me summarize the key obligations."

### Technique 3: Representative Examples
**Before**: [Your actual Q3 financial data]
**After**: "I have sales data showing 15% growth in Product A but 10% decline in Product B. Help me analyze potential drivers."

## Company Policies

### Check With Your Company

**Questions to ask**:
1. Do we have an AI usage policy?
2. Are there approved AI tools?
3. What data classification rules apply?
4. Do we have enterprise AI accounts?

**If unsure**: Ask your manager or IT/Security team

### Common Company Rules
- Use company-provided AI accounts (not personal)
- No confidential data in free AI tools
- Certain data requires approval before sharing
- Regular security training required

**Follow your company's rules** - they may be stricter than this guide.

---

## Verification & Oversight

### Always Verify AI Output For:
- Facts and statistics
- Legal or regulatory information
- Financial calculations
- Technical specifications
- Medical or health information

**Why**: AI can confidently state incorrect information. Verify anything consequential.

### Human Review Required For:
- Customer-facing communications (before sending)
- Legal documents
- Financial reports
- Performance reviews
- Anything representing your company officially

## Best Practices Checklist

Before using AI for a task, ask:

- [ ] Does this contain customer PII? If yes, anonymize or don't use
- [ ] Is this company confidential? If yes, can it be generalized?
- [ ] Would this violate any policies? If yes, don't use
- [ ] Am I using a paid account with better privacy? Recommended
- [ ] Will I verify the output before using it? Always required

## If You Make a Mistake

**If you accidentally shared sensitive data**:

1. **Stop**: Don't share more
2. **Delete**: Delete the conversation if possible
3. **Report**: Tell your security team if it's company data
4. **Learn**: Update your practices to prevent it again

**Remember**: One mistake doesn't mean AI is unsafe. Learn and be more careful next time.

---

## The Balance: Security + Utility

**Goal**: Use AI effectively while protecting sensitive information

**How**:
- Focus on the structure and type of problem, not confidential specifics
- Use ranges instead of exact numbers when possible ("$40-60K" not "$52,347")
- Anonymize examples
- Think "representative scenario" not "actual case"

**If you need to work with truly sensitive data**: Do the analysis elsewhere, then use AI to help format, explain, or present the findings.

---

## Quick Reference Card

✅ Public information
