## When to Upgrade

### Upgrade to Plus/Pro When:
✅ You use AI 3+ times per week for work
✅ You're hitting free tier limits
✅ You work with client/company data

**ROI**: If you save 1 hour/week, that's worth $20/month for most professionals

### Upgrade to Enterprise When:
✅ 10+ employees using AI regularly
✅ Need compliance (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA)
✅ Want admin controls and oversight
✅ Require custom contracts
✅ Need dedicated support
✅ Building AI into products/workflows

**ROI**: Typically worth it at 20+ users or when compliance required

## Common Questions

### "Will my boss pay for Plus?"
**Make the case:**
- Show time saved (hours per week)
- Calculate ROI (your hourly rate × hours saved)
- Explain privacy benefits
- Frame as: "$20/month tool that saves 5 hours/week"

**Template email:**
> "I've been using AI for [tasks] and it's saving me ~5 hours/week. The Plus version costs $20/month and provides better privacy and unlimited use. Given my hourly rate, this is a 20x ROI. Can we expense it?"

### "Can I use personal Plus for work?"
**Yes, but:**
- Check company IT policy
- Be extra careful about data privacy
- Company can't see your usage (good or bad)
- You're responsible for following policies

**Better**: Ask if company will provide Team/Enterprise account

### "What if I'm between jobs?"
- Use free tier while unemployed
- Upgrade when you have income
- Or: Budget $20/month as professional investment

## Making the Switch

### Upgrade Path

**Start**: Free account

**Evaluate**: Am I hitting limits? Saving time?
**Upgrade**: Plus/Pro if using regularly

### What Happens to Your Data When You Upgrade?

**From Free to Plus:**
- Previous free conversations may have been used for training already
- New conversations after upgrade won't be used
- Can't retroactively protect old conversations

**Best practice**: Start with Plus if doing work tasks

---

## Bottom Line

**If you use AI for work**: Get Plus/Pro ($20/month)
**If just testing**: Start Free, upgrade when ready
**ROI**: Usually 10-20x return on investment

### For Companies:
**<10 people**: Individual Plus/Pro accounts with guidelines
**10-50 people**: Team plan ($25/user)
**50+ people or regulated**: Enterprise (custom pricing)

### Privacy-Conscious:
**Minimum**: Plus/Pro for work use
**Ideal**: Enterprise if company-wide deployment
**Never**: Free accounts for sensitive company data

---

**The upgrade is worth it. $20/month to save hours every week and protect your data is a no-brainer for professionals.**
