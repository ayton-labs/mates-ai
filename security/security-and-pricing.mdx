**The essentials**: What to share, what not to share, and whether to pay for AI.

---

## Data Privacy: The Golden Rule

**"Would I email this to a stranger?"**
- **If NO** → Don't put it in AI
- **If YES** → Generally safe

---

## What NOT to Share

**Customer Information:**
- Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Payment details, health information, IDs

**Company Confidential:**
- Financial statements (exact numbers)
- Proprietary algorithms or IP
- Unreleased product plans
- Contract terms and pricing
- Employee personal data

**Security Sensitive:**
- Passwords, API keys, credentials
- Internal system details

---

## What IS Safe to Share

**Anonymized Examples:**
- "A customer spent $5000" (not "John Smith spent $5000")
- "We have a supplier contract worth $X-Y" (not exact terms)

**General Use:**
- Your own email drafts and documents
- Public competitor information
- Your meeting notes (without names)
- Scenario-based questions ("A customer is unhappy about...")

## Account Types & Pricing

| Type | Cost | Privacy | Use For |
|------|------|---------|---------|

| **Plus/Pro** | $20/mo | Better - doesn't train on your data | Professional work |
| **Team** | $25-30/user | Good - collaboration features | Small teams (10-50 people) |

## How to Anonymize Data

**Remove Identifiers:**
- Before: "Sarah Johnson at TechCorp bought $50K"
- After: "A customer at a mid-size tech company bought $50K"

**Use Placeholders:**
- Before: [Full contract details]
- After: "Contract with pricing, timeline, cancellation clauses - help me summarize obligations"

**Use Ranges:**
- Instead of "$52,347" use "$50-55K"

---

## Industry-Specific Rules

**Healthcare**: Never share patient names/PHI (HIPAA) - Use BAA-enabled Enterprise only

**Legal**: Never share client confidential info - Check bar association AI guidelines

**Finance**: Never share account numbers or personal financial data - Enterprise recommended

**HR**: Never share candidate personal information

---

## Making the Case to Your Boss

**Template email:**

**Key points:**

3. Can I use personal AI accounts for work?

**Follow your company's rules** - they may be stricter than this guide.

## Best Practices Checklist

Before using AI:
- [ ] Does this contain customer PII? → Anonymize or don't use
- [ ] Is this company confidential? → Generalize or don't use
- [ ] Am I using a paid account? → Recommended for work
- [ ] Will I verify the output? → Always required

---

## If You Make a Mistake

If you accidentally shared sensitive data:
1. **Stop** using that conversation
2. **Delete** the conversation if possible
3. **Report** to security team if company data
4. **Learn** and adjust your process

---

## Quick Reference

**Safe:**
✅ Your drafts
✅ Anonymized examples
✅ Public info
✅ General scenarios

**Don't Share:**
❌ Customer PII
❌ Contract specifics
❌ Passwords/credentials
❌ Proprietary data

**When in doubt**: Anonymize or don't share.

## Bottom Line

### For Individuals:
**If you use AI for work**: Get Plus/Pro ($20/month)
**If just testing**: Start Free, upgrade when ready
**ROI**: Usually 10-20x return on investment

### For Companies:
**Under 10 people**: Individual Plus/Pro accounts with guidelines
**10-50 people**: Team plan ($25/user)
**50+ people or regulated**: Enterprise (custom pricing)

### Privacy-Conscious:
**Minimum**: Plus/Pro for work use
**Ideal**: Enterprise if company-wide deployment

**The upgrade is worth it. $20/month to save hours every week and protect your data is a no-brainer for professionals.**

Think before you paste. Anonymize when possible. Verify outputs.
